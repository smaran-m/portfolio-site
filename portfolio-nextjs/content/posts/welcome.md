# Welcome

This is the first post on my new blog system. I've migrated from a static Neocities site to a more modern Next.js setup that lets me write posts in Markdown.

## What Changed?

- **Modern Stack**: Now using Next.js with static export
- **Blog Support**: Can write posts in Markdown with frontmatter
- **Comments**: Using Utterances for GitHub-based comments
- **Preserved Features**: Kept the interactive canvas, audio visualizer, and ASCII art elements

## What's Next?

I'm planning to write about:

- Procedural generation techniques
- Game development experiments
- Thoughts on AI art and creativity
- Music production process

Stay tuned for more posts. Click below to leave a comment via GitHub Issues.
